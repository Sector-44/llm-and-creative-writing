## The Value, Benefits, and Concerns of Generative AI-Powered Assistance in Writing (2024)
[https://arxiv.org/html/2403.12004v1#S6](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.12004v1#S6)

This paper explores the impact of generative AI technologies on writing, specifically focusing on how people value AI writing assistants and how these tools affect their writing perceptions and performance. Through an experiment, the findings indicate that individuals are willing to sacrifice financial compensation to use AI assistance for writing, particularly when the tasks require high creativity and the AI provides direct content generation. The use of AI writing assistants is shown to enhance productivity and confidence among users. However, there are associated risks, such as reduced accountability and less diversity in writing. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of these results.

## wr-AI-ter: Enhancing Ownership Perception in AI-Driven Script Writing

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into creative domains is increasing, presenting both challenges and opportunities. In screenwriting, personal artistic expression is a fundamental aspect of the creator’s identity and work. The current use of AI in such creative processes can sometimes overshadow the creator’s vision and lead to a reduced sense of ownership over the final product. We introduce wr-AI-ter, an interactive application consisting of four basic stages: Ideation, Structure, Refinement, and Export. While some related work focuses on experts The application is intended to aid users with varying levels of screenwriting proficiency in generating screenplays using artificial intelligence, while preserving their sense of authorship. We conducted a user study with 23 participants, who had different expertise (screenwriting, documentary filmmaking, and VFX artistry). The results indicate that AI has the potential to accelerate the screenwriting process and improve the quality of scripts without compromising the sense of ownership.
