[https://arxiv.org/html/2403.12004v1#S6](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.12004v1#S6)

This paper explores the impact of generative AI technologies on writing, specifically focusing on how people value AI writing assistants and how these tools affect their writing perceptions and performance. Through an experiment, the findings indicate that individuals are willing to sacrifice financial compensation to use AI assistance for writing, particularly when the tasks require high creativity and the AI provides direct content generation. The use of AI writing assistants is shown to enhance productivity and confidence among users. However, there are associated risks, such as reduced accountability and less diversity in writing. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of these results.
