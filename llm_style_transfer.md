## Conversation Style Transfer Using Few Shot Learning
Summary: 
This paper introduces conversation style transfer as a few-shot learning problem, using a novel in-context learning method with style-free dialogues to address limitations in traditional sentence-level approaches. By incorporating multi-turn context, the approach improves the match to the target style, appropriateness, and semantic correctness. Additionally, the paper shows that conversation style transfer can enhance F1 scores in downstream tasks like multi-domain intent classification.

## Text Style Transfer Evaluation Using Large Language Models
Summary:
Evaluating Text Style Transfer (TST) involves complex criteria such as style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, with human evaluation considered the gold standard despite its cost and challenges in reproducibility. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest they could replace or supplement human assessments, as they often match or exceed human performance in diverse tasks, including TST. This research demonstrates that LLMs, particularly through techniques like prompt ensembling, correlate well with human evaluations and can improve the robustness of TST evaluation metrics.

## Unsupervised Text Style Transfer via LLMs and Attention Masking with Multi-way Interactions
Summary:
Unsupervised Text Style Transfer (UTST) in Natural Language Processing seeks to change the style of a sentence without altering its semantics, syntax, or other attributes, a task made difficult by the absence of parallel text pairings. This paper explores the combination of attention masking and Large Language Models (LLMs) to address their respective flaws in producing unsmooth sentences and altering original content. Through methods like pipeline frameworks, knowledge distillation, and in-context learning, the study demonstrates improved style strength, content preservation, and text fluency, achieving new state-of-the-art results on Yelp-clean and Amazon-clean datasets with significant metric improvements.
