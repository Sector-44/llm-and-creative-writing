# [Prompt to GPT-3: Step-by-Step Thinking Instructions for Humor Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13195) -- 2023

Abstract:
Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in
natural language processing, with models like GPT-3
demonstrating impressive capabilities. However, these
models still have limitations when it comes to complex
tasks that require an understanding of the user, such as
mastering human comedy writing strategies. This paper
explores humor generation using GPT-3 by modeling
human comedy writing theory and leveraging step-bystep thinking instructions. In addition, we explore the
role of cognitive distance in creating humor.

"We explores humor generation using GPT-3 by modeling human comedy writing theory and leveraging step-by-step thinking instructions. In addition, we explore the role of cognitive distance in creating humor. Our findings suggest that GPT-3's ability to generate humor can be significantly improved by theory-driven step-by-step thinking instructions."

# [Witscript: A System for Generating Improvised Jokes in a Conversation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02008) -- 2021

Abstract:
A chatbot is perceived as more humanlike and likeable
if it includes some jokes in its output. But most existing
joke generators were not designed to be integrated into
chatbots. This paper presents Witscript, a novel joke
generation system that can improvise original, contextually relevant jokes, such as humorous responses during a conversation. The system is based on joke writing
algorithms created by an expert comedy writer.
Witscript employs well-known tools of natural language processing to extract keywords from a topic sentence and, using wordplay, to link those keywords and
related words to create a punch line. Then a pretrained
neural network language model that has been fine-tuned
on a dataset of TV show monologue jokes is used to
complete the joke response by filling the gap between
the topic sentence and the punch line. A method of internal scoring filters out jokes that don't meet a preset
standard of quality. Human evaluators judged
Witscript's responses to input sentences to be jokes
more than 40% of the time. This is evidence that
Witscript represents an important next step toward giving a chatbot a humanlike sense of humor.


# [Large Dataset and Language Model Fun-Tuning for Humor Recognition](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1394.pdf) -- 2019

Abstract:
The task of humor recognition has attracted a lot of attention recently due to the urge to process large amounts of user-generated texts and rise of conversational agents. We collected a dataset of jokes and funny dialogues in Russian from various online resources and complemented them carefully with unfunny texts with similar lexical properties. The dataset comprises of more than 300,000 short texts, which is significantly larger than any previous humor-related corpus. Manual annotation of 2,000 items proved the reliability of the corpus construction approach. Further, we applied language model fine-tuning for text classification and obtained an F1 score of 0.91 on a test set, which constitutes a considerable gain over baseline methods. The dataset is freely available for research community.

Abstract:
Humor is a highly-valued human skill â€” a sign of intelligence
and creativity. Humor creation is a long-standing problem in
Artificial Intelligence, because it does not easily decompose
and it cannot readily be defined or detected; indeed, many
humans cannot readily create jokes. However, in our survey
of advice from professional comedians, we found evidence
that the humor-generation process can be described. Based
on this survey, we performed an analysis of news satire from
The Onion and decomposed the process of humor creation
into seven microtasks. We then developed a workflow, inspired by the design literature, that invokes these microtasks
in a novel, dynamic manner. To evaluate our microtasks
and workflow, we recruited 20 people, finding that the 85%
of them found the workflow made their process more methodical and the microtasks enabled them to make a wider
variety of jokes.
